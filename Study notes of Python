Start learning Python!

Installed Python3.7.3 and completed environment, with the help of RAY_M's blog: https://www.cnblogs.com/raym/p/9415310.html
The tutorial I used to learn is called "小甲鱼零基础入门学习Python": https://www.bilibili.com/video/av4050443
From today I'd like to record my learning progress on my repository.In order to practice my English, I will record in English as more as possible, but class notes in Chinese for convenience.

Hope I can keep going on learning XD
